= Zero-Config Style Injection
:navtitle: SaaS Magic

PhotoLink is designed to be a "Zero-Config" SaaS. The goal is for photographers to integrate our high-performance galleries into their existing websites without writing a single line of CSS or JavaScript.

== The Challenge

Most SaaS widgets (like Iframes) are black boxes. They don't know the host site's brand colors, fonts, or layout, leading to a disjointed user experience.

== The Solution: Standardized Magic

We utilize a three-part strategy to ensure our album service looks native to every photographer's site.

=== 1. Environment Sniffing (Single Script Tag)

The photographer includes a single `<script>` tag on their site. When this script runs, it performs an audit of the host environment:

[source,javascript]
----
// Example of the sniffing logic
const brandColor = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)
    .getPropertyValue('--primary-color') || '#000';
const font = getComputedStyle(document.body).fontFamily;
----

It then injects the PhotoLink component and passes these identified tokens as parameters.

=== 2. CSS Variable Bridge

The PhotoLink application is built using CSS variables for all UI elements. These variables are mapped to the detected host styles on load.

[source,css]
----
:root {
  --saas-bg: var(--external-bg, #ffffff);
  --saas-text: var(--external-text, #000000);
}
----

=== 3. Proxy-Based Customization

For standalone galleries (e.g., `albums.bigrpicture.com`), our backend "scrapes" the photographer's main site periodically to identify stylesheet links and primary branding. This allows the subdomain to reflect the main site's aesthetic automatically, even without being embedded.

== Implementation Status

[IMPORTANT]
These patterns are currently in the **Architectural Design** phase and are being integrated into the core PhotoLink loader.
