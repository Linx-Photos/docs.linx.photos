:navtitle: Architecture

Linx Photos is built as a robust, scalable backend for the photography industry. It bridges the gap between raw cloud storage and polished client-facing experiences.

== Tech Stack

Linx Photos leverages a modern, typesafe stack to ensure reliability and speed:

* **Framework**: Astro 5.x for content delivery and SolidJS for interactive elements.
* **Database**: Turso (libSQL) using Drizzle ORM for performant, distributed data.
* **Auth**: Lucia Auth supporting major providers (Google, Microsoft, Apple).
* **AI/OCR**: Tesseract.js for scanning physical contracts and converting them to Markdown.

== Business Logic

The platform is designed around a three-tier hierarchy:

1. **Solo**: Independent photographers managing their own workflows.
2. **Teams**: Collaborative groups working on large-scale events.
3. **Studios**: Corporate entities with role-based access for owners, employees, and contractors.

== The "Visual Join" System

Our data organization strategy treats image metadata like a relational database. Photographers can create "Joins" to dynamically generate albums based on:
* Photographer IDs
* Event date ranges
* Image ratings and tags

This logic is mirrored across physical cloud folders (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud) to keep the source of truth synchronized.
